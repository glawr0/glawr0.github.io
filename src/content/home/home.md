## Problem Solver and Software Engineer

<br>
Hello, I'm Ged! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a professional software engineer. I'm primarily focussed on Python development and Cyber Security.

In the past I've worked in Cloud, DevOps, Systems Administration, and as a Consultant.

When I'm not working, I'm usually outdoors and keeping active.

I'm using this site to build my front-end skills.

Get in touch if you'd like to connect!
