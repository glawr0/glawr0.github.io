Where did the time go?

October saw me belatedly return to work. Back to understanding problems, figuring out if I can help to fix them, and maybe even writing code along the way. I've settled into a sister-team from the one I worked on, so I have *some* of their context but I still have a lot to learn. (Mostly) all fun though!

On a personal front I've settled into flat-share life in the city centre for a little while. It's really handy for work, but it's definitely been an eye-opening experience living here. The city rarely sleeps, and when it does it's only in fits and starts.

My running has gone from strength to strength between bouts of the lurgy. The iconic Great Scottish Run was a good day out with a 7 minute PB, and all I had to do was cycle to China to break it...
