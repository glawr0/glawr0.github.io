Well, I'm back from my cycling trip. If you don't know, in April I left my flat in Glasgow and cycled across Europe and Central Asia, reaching as far as Kyrgzstan - touching the border with China in the process!

It was a pretty life-changing experience and it's going to take a while for me to fully process it. I've returned grateful for life and eager to make the most of the next phase of this wild ride.

I'm now resting up and dabbling in tech before returning to work. Remembering how to use a laptop is definitely a novel experience after 10 years in technology!
